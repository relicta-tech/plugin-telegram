## Plugin Architecture

This plugin follows the Relicta Plugin SDK architecture:

```
plugin.go    - Main plugin implementation
main.go      - Plugin entry point (calls plugin.Serve)
*_test.go    - Unit tests
```

Key interfaces to implement:

- `GetInfo()` - Returns plugin metadata
- `Execute()` - Runs the plugin for a given hook
- `Validate()` - Validates plugin configuration

## Questions?

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Join discussions in the main [Relicta repository](https://github.com/relicta-tech/relicta)
